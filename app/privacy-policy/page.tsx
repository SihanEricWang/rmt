          <p>This Privacy Policy applies:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>
              Regardless of whether you access the Site via a personal computer, mobile device, or any other technology
              (each, a “Device”);
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether you access the Site as a registered user (if offered) or as an unregistered visitor;
            </li>
            <li>To all information (“Information”) collected by the Site;</li>
            <li>
              To our use of combined information if we combine Information collected through the Site with other
              information we receive in limited ways (for example, administrative or technical logs); and
            </li>
            <li>
              Even if your use of the Site or any feature ends, expires, is suspended, or is deactivated for any reason.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by other companies or websites you may access
            via links from our Site, or to services not owned/operated by the Molarity team.
          </p>

          <p>
            By using the Site or its features, you consent to our privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certain products or services offered by the Site may have additional privacy statements (“Additional Privacy
            Statements”). If provided, those statements are incorporated by reference. If there is a conflict, the
            Additional Privacy Statement controls for that specific feature.
          </p>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">2. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>
            Rate My Teacher-BIPH is a school-focused service intended for use by the{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">BIPH</span> community. The Site may be hosted using third-party
            infrastructure providers (for example, Supabase and hosting providers) and data may be processed where those
            providers operate. If you access the Site from outside the hosting region, you do so at your own risk and
            you are responsible for complying with your local laws.
          </p>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">3. What Information Is Collected</h2>

          <h3 className="text-base font-bold">3.1 Information You Provide</h3>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">3.1.1 User Registration:</span> When you create an account (if offered), we
            collect information such as your email address (typically an internal school email, e.g.{" "}
            <span className="font-mono">@basischina.com</span>) and your authentication credentials (handled via our auth
            provider). We do not ask for sensitive personal identifiers such as government ID numbers.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">3.1.2 In Connection with Site Features:</span> When you post ratings, tags,
            or comments, we collect the content you submit. The Site is designed so posted ratings are shown to other
            users without revealing the author’s identity publicly.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-bold">3.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
          <p>
            Like most sites, we may collect certain technical information automatically, such as IP address, device and
            browser type, operating system, timestamps, pages viewed, and basic diagnostic logs. We may use cookies or
            similar technologies to keep you signed in and to support core Site functionality.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do <span className="font-semibold">not</span> intentionally use the Site for cross-site behavioral
            advertising. If we ever introduce analytics or advertising partners that use tracking technologies, we will
            update this Privacy Policy accordingly and, where required, provide choices/opt-outs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">4. How Collected Information Is Used</h2>
          <p>We use Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>To create and maintain accounts and authenticate users;</li>
            <li>To enable Site features (posting, browsing, sorting, and displaying teacher/course pages);</li>
            <li>To enforce Site Guidelines and keep the community safe;</li>
            <li>To respond to support requests and administer the Site;</li>
            <li>To monitor performance, prevent abuse, and improve the Site.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">5. Your Choices</h2>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">Account:</span> You can choose not to create an account; browsing may still
            be available. Posting content typically requires sign-in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">Cookies:</span> Most browsers let you control cookies. Disabling cookies may
            affect login/session functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold">Content:</span> If you post a rating/comment, you can usually manage or
            remove it using Site features where available, subject to moderation and integrity safeguards.
          </p>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">6. [Reserved]</h2>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">7. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
          <p>We may disclose Information in the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Operational service providers:</span> We use third-party providers to host
              and operate the Site (for example, authentication, database, and hosting). These providers process data on
              our behalf under appropriate safeguards.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Safety, security, and compliance:</span> If required by law, school policy,
              or to protect users and the Site, we may disclose information to appropriate authorities or school
              leadership (for example, credible threats of violence or harm).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Business changes:</span> In the event of a reorganization, migration, or
              transfer of the Site to another operator, information may be transferred as part of that change, subject
              to applicable law and this policy.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="font-semibold">Public display:</p>
          <p>
            Ratings and comments are user-generated. They may be shown publicly within the Site. The Site is designed so
            the author identity is not displayed alongside ratings, but moderators may access certain account metadata
            for safety, abuse prevention, and enforcement of Site Guidelines.
          </p>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">8. Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information</h2>
          <p>
            If you have an account, you may be able to update certain account information. You may also request deletion
            of your account through available Site tools (if provided) or by contacting us (see Section 13). Some
            information may be retained for safety, abuse prevention, legal compliance, or to maintain the integrity of
            the service.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note: deleting your account may not necessarily delete all content you posted if retention is
            required for moderation, safety, or compliance reasons; however, we will handle requests thoughtfully and in
            line with the Site’s mission and obligations.
          </p>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">9. Protection of Information</h2>
          <p>
            We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect
            Information. However, no system is 100% secure. Please use caution when sharing information and avoid posting
            private contact details about yourself or others.
          </p>

            <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-neutral-700">
              We do not send emails asking you to provide or confirm passwords. If you receive a suspicious email

          <p>
            Some jurisdictions provide privacy rights such as access, correction, deletion, and opting out of certain
            processing. Because this Site is a small, school-focused service and collects limited data, some rights may
            be fulfilled via account tools or by contacting us. We will make reasonable efforts to honor applicable
            requests consistent with the Site’s purpose, safety, and legal obligations.
          </p>

          <h2 className="pt-2 text-lg font-extrabold tracking-tight">11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

            We may revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated version on the Site. Changes are
            effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Site after changes are posted indicates your
            acceptance of the updated policy.
          </p>
